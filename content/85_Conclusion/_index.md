### Well Done

Congratulations!  You have completed Observability with Epsagon workshop.  

### Recap on what you have learned
- Learned how to deploy a fully working serverless retail store, including frontend and backend.
- Learned how to quickly and efficiently troubleshoot exceptions and errors in your distributed applications.
- Learned how to visualize and understand the performance of your applications.
- Learned how to leverage metrics, logs and traces to gain observability using Epsagon.

### Final Thoughts
While we learned that gaining complete observability can bring us many benefits, as engineers, it is good to dive deeper and learn more. The following post about [Best Practices for Serverless Observability](https://medium.com/adobetech/best-practices-for-serverless-observability-a99d8dc8af5c) can be a good starting point.

We hope that the workshop you completed has given you a better understanding of AWS Lambda, why observability is important, and how to leverage Epsagon can be beneficial for your organization's monitoring needs.

### Next Steps
* Learn more about the [Epsagon](https://epsagon.com/).
* Start gaining observability into your application using [Epsagon](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/), and the lessons we learned.
