## Performance monitoring

Observing application performance for a long period, and visualizing such complex natures can be very hard.

Luckily at Epsagon, it automatically generates service maps, that allows understanding the dependencies between resources, errors, and performance breakdowns.

Head to the service map screen in Epsagon, and click on `get-items` Lambda function:

![Service map](/images/monitoring/service_map.png)

Try to understand where does your function spends most of its time?

Over time, service maps can become handy to observe your application, understand complexities, and pinpoint performance issues. Review this service map as you make more requests to your retail store.
